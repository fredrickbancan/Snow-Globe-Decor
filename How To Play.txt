Snow Globe Décor is an atmospheric sandbox game where you are tasked with decorating a snow globe staged in a dark, wintery night on Christmas eve. Do your best to make the snow globe as warm and inviting as possible. 

Press W, A, S, and D to move around the snow globe.
Moving the mouse allows you to move your view and reticle.
Use the mouse scroll wheel to scroll up and down to select a decoration.

For stringed decorations, click and drag on surfaces to spawn them into the world.
For single object decorations (i.e., tree and snowman), click on the ground to spawn them into the world.

Press ESC to open the pause menu, where you can hide/show the in-game GUI for taking screenshots or recordings. 
You can also quit to main menu, which clears all decorations.
 Click “Toggle Globe View” to see your snow globe in its entirety. You can then press ESC again, and click “Toggle Globe View” again, to go back into the globe to continue decorating.
